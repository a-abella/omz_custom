# `.oh-my-zsh/custom`

The user custom content directory for oh-my-zsh.

`tools.zsh` and `tools.d/*.zsh` contain functions I find useful in everyday life like an AWS profile manager and synchronizer, dot-env file management utility, and other bits and bobs.

`themes/agnoster-mod.zsh` extends the Agnoster theme with better AWS profile prompt, and provides a Kubernetes/kubectl status prompt displaying current context and current namespace within that context.
